### 🛠️ End-to-End Data Pipelines & Dashboards

- [**London Bike Rides: ETL & Interactive Dashboard**]([London Bike/London Bike Rides EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/GawrGaUwU/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/London%20Bike/London%20Bike%20Rides%20EDA.ipynb)) 
  **[🔗 View Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/shared/XWQGWS5X9)**
  A comprehensive project transforming 17,000+ rows of raw mobility data into actionable urban insights. 
  * **Tech Stack:** Python (Pandas), Tableau.
  * **Highlights:** Automated ETL (semantic mapping and normalization) and an interactive dashboard featuring dynamic moving averages and weather-correlation heatmaps.
  * **Outcome:** Identified critical "Goldilocks" weather zones (7°C–22°C) and confirmed ridership is primarily driven by workday commuting patterns.

### 🔍 Data Analysis and Visualization

- [**Pokémon Stats EDA**](https://github.com/GawrGaUwU/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Pokemon/Pok%C3%A9mon%20Stats%20EDA.ipynb) [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.io/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GawrGaUwU/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Pokemon/Pok%C3%A9mon%20Stats%20EDA.ipynb)  
  This dataset includes 721 Pokémon, covering their types and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It serves as a foundation for learning exploratory statistical analysis and distribution plotting.
